                        Our trip captains are nothing short of heroes. Brave, dynamic, and great leaders, they’re certainly the showrunners of the community trips. They’ve been handpicked from India’s best travel institutes, and know all tricks of trade to lead and manage all kinds of trips, including all backpaking trips.

                        Being the bridge between the local vendors and the customers, we’re very selective about the former. After a rigorous recci, we’ve found the most kind and hospitable vendors, who make our travelers feel at home, even when they might be miles away from it. Over the period of time, we’ve managed to make a family-like relationship with our vendors, thus giving back to the local community in every way possible!
