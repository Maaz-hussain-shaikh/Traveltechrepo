              Do you remember the slam books of your childhood and how they featured typical career aspirations like becoming a scientist, teacher, or doctor? Back then, no one could have predicted a career in the travel industry, let alone becoming a travelpreneur. However, as time progresses, we come to realize that a career can be anything that solves problems for society.

              A group of engineers from MIT Ujjain recognized that the Indian travel industry needed a fresh infusion of youthful energy to transform the agent-based model into a more user-friendly, transparent, and accessible community for Indian travelers. And so, the idea of Trarveltech was born.

              This is the story of passionate individuals on a mission to revolutionize people's lives with unforgettable travel experiences.
